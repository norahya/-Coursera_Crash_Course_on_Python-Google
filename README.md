# Crash Course on Python Exercises
This repository contains the code I developed during the Crash Course on Python by Google, offered on Coursera. In this course, I learned the fundamentals of Python, including basic syntax, data types, and automation using scripts. I explored loops, conditionals, and more complex data structures like strings, lists, and dictionaries. Additionally, I applied problem-solving techniques to tackle a final project, where I put together everything I learned to analyze and break down a real-world problem. This repository showcases my progress through programming assignments and practical exercises.
